The soundtrack is broken up into time periods following the tech tree and is 
split by peace time and combat. Peace is generally defined when you are 
"farming" and growing your civilization with no fighting going on at all. Any 
kind of fighting, inlcuding defense of your cities will trigger combat and the 
music will change. After 16 turns of no combat the music will return to peace.

At the beginning of the game, you select the style of music you want to hear by 
picking the city style of your civilization. The current choices are:

- European
- Classical
- Tropical
- Asian
- Babylonian
- Celtic

The city style is automatically selected for you when you pick your nation, but 
you can change it if you like. The European and Classical soundtracks are 
similar to each other. The rest are unique.

The discovery of University changes the music for all city styles for the 
Renaissance Age. All further disoveries noted below will change the music for 
all city styles/nations.

The discovery of Railroad brings in the Industrial Age.  The soundtrack 
moves to more combat music at this point since a lot of fighting occurs around 
this time in most games.

The discovery of Automobile brings in the Electric Age soundtrack.

The discovery of Rocketry brings in the Modern Age soundtrack.

The discovery of Superconductors brings in the Post-Modern Age soundtrack. This 
is the final soundtrack of the game.

IMPACT ON GAMEPLAY:
-------------------

The whole purpose of this music soundtrack is to give Freeciv a more friendly 
and pleasing sound. All of the music is high quality, fits the time period and 
just feels right.
